pygments-theme-darcula
======================

The darcula theme from Jetbrains IDEA for pygments. This stylesheet is not perfect but it looks almost the same with
php, css, html and yaml and puppet files. The highlights don't exactly match the highlighting in PhpStorm because
pygments doesn't label some of the keywords with the same classes (most visible with puppet files).

Embed the darcula.css in your website or include darcula.less in your existing less structure.
All highlight classes are prefixed with `.highlight`

For a demo for multiple languages visit [brixit.nl](http://brixit.nl/). This highlight theme is used for
all the code blocks on the site.
